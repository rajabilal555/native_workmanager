## [1.3.2] - 2026-07-07

### Fixed

- **iOS: startup crash on Flutter 3.38+ (UIScene template) — Issue #36.**
  Apps created with the Flutter 3.38+ iOS template register plugins in
  `AppDelegate.didInitializeImplicitFlutterEngine`, which runs *after*
  `application(_:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:)` returns. Calling
  `BGTaskScheduler.register` at that point violates Apple's
  "all launch handlers must be registered before application finishes launching"
  rule and threw `NSInternalInconsistencyException` at startup
  (reported on iPhone 15 / iOS 18.6.2; affects any device on the new template).
  - BGTask launch handlers are now registered in an ObjC `+load` hook
    (`NWMBGTaskRegistrar`) that runs at binary load time — always inside the
    launch window, on both the old and the new template. Plugin registration
    only attaches the Swift handlers afterwards.
  - All `BGTaskScheduler.register` calls now go through ObjC `@try/@catch`
    (Swift cannot catch `NSException`): late or duplicate registration degrades
    to a `BGTASK_REGISTRATION_FAILED` system error instead of a crash.
  - Fixed a latent duplicate-registration crash: `registerHandlers()` had no
    idempotency guard, so `GeneratedPluginRegistrant` re-running on the headless
    background engine (`FlutterEngineManager`) re-registered the identifiers and
    threw the same `NSInternalInconsistencyException`.
  - BGTasks that fire before the Swift side attaches (cold-start background
    launch) are buffered and delivered once handlers attach.

### Added

- iOS: `NativeWorkmanagerPlugin.registerBGTaskHandlers()` — optional explicit
  registration from `didFinishLaunchingWithOptions` (idempotent, exception-safe).
  Only needed if a build setup strips ObjC `+load` sections.
- Example app migrated to the Flutter 3.38+ UIScene template
  (`FlutterImplicitEngineDelegate` + `SceneDelegate`) so the device test suite
  runs on the lifecycle that triggered the crash; new `issue_36` device
  regression test asserts handlers are registered in `+load`, exactly once.

## [1.3.1] - 2026-06-07

### Fixed
- **Android (critical regression, since v1.2.4)**: All file-based native workers
  (`HttpDownload`, `HttpUpload`, `ParallelHttpDownload/Upload`, `FileCompression`,
  `FileDecompression`, `ImageProcess`, `Crypto` hash/encrypt/decrypt, `Pdf`,
  `WebSocket`, `FileSystem`, `MoveToSharedStorage`) failed on real devices with
  "Invalid or unsafe file path". v1.2.4 added a blanket `"/data"` entry to
  `SecurityValidator`'s blocked-prefix list, which rejected the app's own private
  sandbox (`/data/data/<pkg>`, `/data/user/<n>/<pkg>` — exactly what `path_provider`
  returns). The validator now blocks only the genuinely OS-owned sub-directories of
  `/data` (`/data/local`, `/data/system`, `/data/misc`, `/data/app`, …) while
  allowing the app sandbox. Path-traversal protection (canonical-path resolution)
  and blocking of `/proc`, `/sys`, `/etc`, `/system`, `/vendor`, `/dev`, `/root`
  are unchanged. Added `SecurityValidatorFilePathTest` (Kotlin) plus device
  coverage in the "All Workers" integration group.
- **iOS**: Fixed an issue where the `KMPWorkManager.xcframework` was extracted into a double-nested path (`Frameworks/Frameworks/KMPWorkManager.xcframework`) during `pod install`, causing iOS builds to fail with "Unable to find module dependency: 'KMPWorkManager'". The `prepare_command` in `native_workmanager.podspec` is now layout-agnostic (Resolves #33).

## [1.3.0] - 2026-06-04

### Added
- **Android Auto-Init** (`NativeWorkManagerInitializer`): Plugin now ships an `androidx.startup`
  `Initializer` declared in its own `AndroidManifest.xml`. It runs automatically before
  `Application.onCreate()`, restoring the `callbackHandle` from SharedPreferences and
  initializing `KmpWorkManager` with `SimpleAndroidWorkerFactory`.
  - **Breaking zero-config change:** `DartWorker` killed-app support now requires **no custom
    `Application` class and no manual `AndroidManifest.xml` edits** for the common case.
  - **Opt-out** for apps with custom WorkManager configuration: add
    `<meta-data android:name="native_workmanager.auto_init" android:value="false" />` to
    `<application>` in your `AndroidManifest.xml`, then follow `doc/ANDROID_SETUP.md`.
  - `isSchedulerInitialized` flag prevents double-initialization when `onAttachedToEngine`
    runs after the Initializer.

- **Unified setup CLI** (`dart run native_workmanager:setup`): Evolves `setup_ios` into a
  universal command covering both platforms.
  - `--android`: validates the app manifest has no conflicts with auto-init.
  - `--ios`: patches `Info.plist` with `UIBackgroundModes` and
    `BGTaskSchedulerPermittedIdentifiers` (same as the legacy `setup_ios` command).
  - `--check`: read-only validation mode — no files are written.
  - `--help`: full usage reference.
  - `setup_ios` executable retained for backward compatibility.

- **iOS `WorkerResult.retry()`**: Added `retry(reason:delayMs:attemptCap:)` factory on
  the Swift `WorkerResult` struct, providing parity with `WorkerResult.Retry` introduced
  in kmpworkmanager v2.5.0.

### Changed
- **Core**: Upgraded KMP WorkManager core dependency from v2.4.3 to v2.5.1.
  - Android: added `WorkerResult.Retry` branch in `ForegroundNativeWorker` to satisfy
    sealed-class exhaustiveness (maps to `Result.retry()`).
  - iOS `KMPWorkManager.xcframework` rebuilt from v2.5.1 source.

- **iOS retry semantics** (`executeWorkerSync`): the retry loop now respects
  `WorkerResult.shouldRetry`. A worker returning `failure(shouldRetry: false)` stops
  retrying immediately instead of exhausting all `maxRetries` attempts.

- **iOS `maxRetries` honored** on the direct-task execution path: `RetryConfig.from(constraintsMap:)`
  is now called and passed to `executeWorkerSync`. Previously `Constraints.maxRetries` was
  silently ignored on iOS (dead code).

- **iOS direct-task `qos`** now read from `constraintsMap["qos"]` instead of being
  hardcoded to `"background"`.

### Fixed
- **Android `DartCallbackWorker`**: `CancellationException` is now rethrown before the
  outer `catch (Exception)` block. `executeDartCallback` is a suspending function; without
  this fix, WorkManager task cancellation was silently converted to a `Failure` result.

- **iOS WebSocket**: `NativeWorker.webSocket()` now throws `UnsupportedError` at call-site
  when run on iOS. Previously the task was enqueued and silently failed with
  "Unknown worker class" because `IosWorkerFactory` has no `WebSocketWorker` case.

- **Android `handleResume`**: constraint JSON parse failure now logs a `NativeLogger.w`
  warning instead of silently falling back to empty constraints (which could cause resumed
  downloads to ignore `requiresNetwork` / `requiresCharging`).

- **Dart `resolveDispatcherTimeout`**: values ≤ 0 (zero, negative, NaN, ±Infinity) now
  fall back to the 25 s default. A `Duration(milliseconds: -n).timeout()` fires immediately,
  which would kill every DartWorker. Added four regression tests.

- **Android `HttpDownloadWorker` — data corruption** (directory mode): concurrent downloads
  to the same directory now each use their own temp file (`__pending_<taskId>__.tmp`)
  instead of sharing the hardcoded `__pending__.tmp`. Two workers writing to the same
  temp path produced a mixed-byte file; the first to finish would rename corrupted data.

- **Android `HttpDownloadWorker` — TOCTOU rename** (`onDuplicate: "rename"`): replaced
  `findNextAvailableFile() + Files.move(REPLACE_EXISTING)` with an atomic probe loop using
  `ATOMIC_MOVE` only (no `REPLACE_EXISTING`). A `FileAlreadyExistsException` now signals
  the next candidate rather than silently overwriting a file from a concurrent download.

- **Android constraint conflict warning**: enqueueing with `allowWhileIdle: true` and
  `isHeavyTask: true` simultaneously now logs a `NativeLogger.w` at enqueue time. The
  long-running worker already bypasses Doze mode, making `allowWhileIdle` redundant and
  potentially causing WorkManager rejection on some Android versions.

## [1.2.8] - 2026-06-04

### Changed
- **Core**: Upgraded KMP WorkManager core dependency from v2.4.3 to v2.5.1.
  - Android: added `WorkerResult.Retry` branch in `ForegroundNativeWorker` to satisfy sealed-class exhaustiveness (maps to `Result.retry()`).
  - iOS: added `WorkerResult.retry(reason:delayMs:attemptCap:)` factory method for parity with the new KMP sealed variant; existing `failure(shouldRetry: true)` callers unchanged.
  - iOS `KMPWorkManager.xcframework` rebuilt from v2.5.1 source.

## [1.2.7] - 2026-05-11

### Fixed
- **Core**: Enforced `DartWorker.timeoutMs` end-to-end (Issue #30).
  - Android and iOS bridges now correctly forward `timeoutMs` to the Dart callback dispatcher.
  - Added `resolveDispatcherTimeout` helper in Dart to securely parse the timeout, protecting against `NaN`, `Infinity`, and invalid types.
  - Enforced `timeoutMs` in both the background dispatcher and the foreground `MethodChannel` (`_executeDartCallback`).
  - Added comprehensive unit, integration, performance, and security test coverage.

## [1.2.6] - 2026-05-08

### Added
- **Android**: **Industrial-grade Foreground Service (FGS) Support**. Added `ForegroundNotificationConfig` to `Constraints`, allowing tasks to run as prioritized Foreground Services to bypass Android 12+ background restrictions.
- **Android**: Full compliance with Android 14 (API 34) Foreground Service Types. Automatically maps task types (dataSync, location, media, etc.) to system-level flags.
- **Android**: Proactive task promotion using `setForeground()` to ensure immediate execution even when the app is in the background.
- **Android**: FGS state persistence: configuration is automatically restored after device reboots or task resumes.
- **Core**: Added comprehensive unit tests and a new Demo page in the example app for FGS bypass.

### Fixed
- **Android**: Fixed regression where background tasks would not fire when the device screen was locked (Doze mode) even after the app was killed. Resolved by correctly mapping `allowWhileIdle` to WorkManager's expedited mode ([#28](https://github.com/brewkits/native_workmanager/issues/28)).
- **iOS**: Fixed Swift Concurrency deadlocks by migrating SQLite queues (DispatchQueue) from concurrent to serial.
- **iOS**: Improved scheduling reliability by adjusting internal `TaskTrigger` execution delays on iOS to ensure `BGTaskScheduler` correctly enqueues tasks.
- **Test**: Added platform-aware timeouts for iOS integration tests and automatically excluded timeout-prone integration tests (`TaskGraph` and `OfflineQueue`) when running on the iOS Simulator.

## [1.2.5] - 2026-05-06

### Fixed
- **Core**: Removed over-restrictive assertion in `TaskTrigger.periodic` that prevented using `initialDelay` and `runImmediately: false` together ([#26](https://github.com/brewkits/native_workmanager/issues/26)).
- **iOS**: Fixed bug where `runImmediately` flag was incorrectly recomputed from `initialDelay` instead of using the user-provided value.

## [1.2.4] - 2026-04-29

### Fixed
- **Android**: Added automatic ProGuard rules to prevent task classes from being stripped in Release builds ([#24](https://github.com/brewkits/native_workmanager/issues/24)).
- **Android**: Clarified that `Application` class setup is required for all tasks to survive app kill.
- **iOS**: Synchronized background task identifiers between `setup_ios.dart` and Swift code.
- **iOS**: `getTaskStatus()` now correctly returns `TaskStatus.completed` for finished tasks. Previously, the iOS plugin wrote `"success"` to SQLite but Dart's `TaskStatus` enum has no `success` case, so every call returned `null`.
- **Android**: Removed duplicate `taskStore.updateStatus()` call on task completion. The redundant second write used `JSONObject(map).toString()` which could corrupt nested result maps, overwriting the correctly-encoded first write.
- **iOS**: `FlutterEngineManager` now disposes the engine after a Dart callback timeout. Previously the engine remained `isInitialized = true` with a hung `MethodChannel`, causing all subsequent `DartCallbackWorker` tasks to silently fail (timeout again).

### Changed
- **Engine**: Upgraded core `kmpworkmanager` to v2.4.3 (re-publish of v2.4.2 to fix Maven Central artifact issue; no code changes).

## [1.2.3] - 2026-04-24

### Added
- **Feature: Support `initialDelay` and `runImmediately` for periodic tasks** ([#21](https://github.com/brewkits/native_workmanager/issues/21))
  - Allows delaying the first execution of a periodic task.
  - Added `runImmediately` flag to skip the first execution.
  - On Android, uses native `PeriodicWorkRequest.setInitialDelay()`.
  - On iOS, maps `initialDelay` to `earliestBeginDate` for optimized scheduling.
  - Added parameters to `TaskTrigger.periodic()`.
- **Security: Advanced Input Validation**
  - All native workers now perform strict validation to block **Null Byte Injection**, **Path Traversal** (`..`, `%2e%2e`), and **Shell Injection** characters in URLs and file paths.
- **Enterprise-Grade Testing**:
  - Implemented comprehensive `scripts/run_all_tests.sh` covering Unit, Integration, Security, Performance, and Stress tests.
  - Added specific performance benchmarks for task scheduling overhead.
  - Added malicious payload protection tests.
- **Improved CI/CD**: Integrated automated Security, Performance, and Stress testing into the GitHub Actions pipeline.

### Fixed
- **Android: Upgraded to `kmpworkmanager 2.4.1`**
  - Switched to native `setInitialDelay` instead of manual bypass logic.
  - Fixed edge-case crashes on Android 15.
- **iOS: Improved Periodic Task Lifecycle**
  - Fixed regression where periodic tasks were not tracked in `activeTasks`, preventing cancellation.
- **Android: Fixed broken `expedited` flag logic** in direct enqueue path.

## [1.2.2] - 2026-04-22

### Added
- **`registerPlugins` parameter** in `NativeWorkManager.initialize()`: opt-in flag to register all Flutter plugins in the background engine, required when using plugins like `flutter_local_notifications` inside `DartWorker` callbacks. Defaults to `false` to preserve the Zero-Engine I/O principle and avoid side-effects (e.g. Bluetooth disconnects). Also added `NativeWorkmanagerPlugin.setPluginRegistrantCallback` on Android and iOS to allow selective plugin registration when `registerPlugins` is false. ([#18](https://github.com/brewkits/native_workmanager/issues/18))

### Fixed
- **iOS: `openFile` always fails on Flutter 3.38+ / scene-based apps** — `UIApplication.shared.keyWindow` returns `nil` in `UIWindowScene` lifecycle. Replaced with a new `activeRootViewController` extension that traverses `connectedScenes` to find the active key window. ([#16](https://github.com/brewkits/native_workmanager/issues/16))
- **Android: `StackOverflowError` when middleware is registered** — Kotlin companion extension `applyMiddleware` was shadowing the internal package-level function of the same name, causing infinite recursion. Renamed the internal function to `applyMiddlewareInternal` to eliminate the ambiguity. ([#17](https://github.com/brewkits/native_workmanager/issues/17))
- **`native_workmanager_gen` incompatible with Flutter 3.41.x** — `analyzer >=11.0.0` requires `meta ^1.18.0` which conflicts with the Flutter SDK's `meta 1.17.0` pin. Widened constraint to `>=10.0.0 <13.0.0`; `analyzer 10.x` supports all APIs used by the generator and requires only `meta ^1.15.0`. ([#15](https://github.com/brewkits/native_workmanager/issues/15))

## [1.2.1] - 2026-04-19

### Added
- **Security Hardening**: All HTTP workers now support **HTTPS Enforcement** and **Private IP Blocking (SSRF Protection)** via `NativeWorkManager.initialize(enforceHttps: true, blockPrivateIPs: true)`.
- **Path Traversal Protection**: Enhanced file path validation to block null-byte injection and encoded dot-segments (`%2e%2e`) across all native workers.
- **`WorkManagerLogger` interface**: A type-safe delegate for forwarding background task events to third-party SDKs like Firebase or Sentry without dynamic reflection.
- **New Test Suite**: Added 100+ new test cases covering input sanitization, security policy enforcement, performance benchmarks for large directory operations, and multi-stage task chains.

### Fixed
- **Android: Dart Isolate Timeouts**: Implemented hard timeout handling for background Dart execution. If an isolate hangs, the engine is now force-disposed to prevent 50MB+ RAM leaks.
- **Android: Task Store Performance**: Added batch deletion for task history cleanup to prevent long SQLite write-locks on high-traffic apps.
- **Migration Tool**: Moved the `migrate.dart` script to the `bin/` directory and added it to the `executables` section in `pubspec.yaml` to resolve the `Could not find bin/migrate.dart` error when running `dart run native_workmanager:migrate` (#14). Also changed `developer.log` to `print` so the CLI output displays correctly.
- **Test Infrastructure**: Fixed a bug in `TaskEventTracker` where it incorrectly resolved on \"task started\" events instead of terminal completion events, leading to flakey stress tests.

---

## [1.2.0] - 2026-04-17

### Added
- **Android cold-start `DartWorker` persistence**: `DartWorker` tasks now execute reliably after app kill. The `callbackHandle` is persisted to `SharedPreferences` (Android) and `UserDefaults` (iOS) during `initialize()` and automatically restored when WorkManager restarts the process. Requires host app to implement `Configuration.Provider` — see `doc/ANDROID_SETUP.md`.
- **Advanced Remote Trigger**: Support for direct commands in push payloads (`native_wm` key). Execute tasks, chains (`enqueue_chain`), graphs, and offline queues without waking Flutter. Both Android and iOS support executing task chains completely in the background.
- **HMAC Security**: Robust HMAC SHA-256 signature verification for remote triggers (supporting nested objects) to prevent unauthorized task execution.
- **Real-time Observability**: DevTools extension now supports real-time event streaming via `developer.postEvent`.
- **Global Middleware API**: Global interceptors for task configuration (Headers, RemoteConfig, Logging).
- **Code Generation Enhancements**: `native_workmanager_gen` now generates type-safe enqueue wrappers and automatic worker registries from `@WorkerCallback` annotations.
- **Task Graphs (DAG)**: Support for complex non-linear task dependencies on Android.
