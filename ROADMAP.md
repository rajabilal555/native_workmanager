# native_workmanager Roadmap

Our mission is to provide the most robust, efficient, and secure background execution engine for Flutter.

---
## ✅ Completed (v1.2.x)
- **v1.2.6 Industrial Reliability & FGS Bypass:**
  - **Foreground Service (FGS) Support (Android)**: Bypass Android 12+ background restrictions for heavy tasks with prioritized notifications.
  - **Locked Device Support (Android)**: Optimized task execution during Doze mode via Expedited Work mapping.
  - **Swift Concurrency Stability (iOS)**: Eliminated database deadlocks by migrating to serial dispatch queues.
  - **iOS Scheduling Reliability**: Tuned internal delays to ensure consistent `BGTaskScheduler` enqueuing.
  - **Platform-Aware Test Suite**: Comprehensive integration tests with automatic simulator detection and isolation.
- **v1.2.3 Critical Core Stability:** 
...
  - Bypassed Android's 10KB WorkManager payload limit via automated secure file spilling (`wm_spill_*.json`).
  - Fixed iOS URLSession background file loss with synchronous blocking moves.
  - Eliminated iOS `BGTaskScheduler` starvation and race conditions via `TaskCompletionGuard`.
  - Full I/O interruption support: `worker.stop()` now drops mid-flight network connections on cancel.
  - Added `initialDelay` and `runImmediately` support for Periodic Tasks.
  - Advanced Security: Strict validation against Null Byte Injection, Path Traversal (`..`), and Shell Injection.
- **Android Cold-Start Persistence:** `DartWorker` execution reliably survives app kills and restores automatically.
- **Advanced Remote Trigger (FCM/APNs):** Enqueue complete Task Chains and Offline Queues via silent push without waking the Flutter Engine.
- **HMAC Security:** Robust HMAC SHA-256 signature verification for remote triggers.
- **Real-Time Observability & Middleware:** DevTools extension real-time visualizer and global interceptors.
- **Code Generation (`native_workmanager_gen`):** Generate type-safe enqueue wrappers via `@WorkerCallback` annotations.
- **Selective Plugin Registration:** Explicit opt-in flag `registerPlugins` to control background engine memory footprint.

## 🛠 v1.3.0 — "Zero-Config" & Developer Experience (Current Priority)

To drive mass adoption and reach 100k+ downloads, v1.3.0 focuses entirely on lowering the barrier to entry.

### 1. Android Auto-Init (Zero Native Setup)
Today, `DartWorker` requires manual Kotlin/XML steps to survive app kill. In v1.3.0, the plugin will ship its own `androidx.startup` `Initializer` that runs before `Application.onCreate()`.
- **Impact:** Eliminates the need for a custom `Application` class, `AndroidManifest.xml` modifications, and manual WorkManager initializer removal.
- **Opt-out:** Apps with custom WorkManager configs can disable auto-init via a single `<meta-data>` flag.

### 2. Unified CLI Setup Tool (`dart run native_workmanager:setup`)
- Evolves `setup_ios` into a universal command.
- **Android:** Automatically patches `AndroidManifest.xml` (for advanced opt-out/custom setups).
- **iOS:** Automatically parses and injects `BGTaskSchedulerPermittedIdentifiers` into `Info.plist` and injects Objective-C `+load` method or `AppDelegate` code for background registration.
- **Impact:** "1-Click Setup" for both platforms. No Native knowledge required.

## 🧩 Phase 2: Ecosystem, Templates & Integrations (v1.4.x - v1.5.x)

To capture mindshare from legacy libraries, we must provide "Plug & Play" solutions.

- [ ] **Cross-Integrations (Adapters):**
  - `NativeDioAdapter`: Use Dio configurations but execute via the Zero-Engine `HttpDownloadWorker`.
  - `FirebaseStorage Native`: Upload directly via Native SDK without booting Flutter.
  - `Hive/Isar Sync`: Auto-sync local DB to server via native workers.
- [ ] **"Plug & Play" Templates Repository:**
  - Provide ready-to-use Dart templates for common use cases: *Auto Photo Backup to S3*, *Offline Chat Queue*, *Netflix-style Large Video Download*.
- [ ] **Native Offline Queue Engine:** Built-in declarative pattern for queuing tasks while offline with automatic file/database-backed retry.
- [ ] **SwiftUI `@main` App Support:** CLI tool detects SwiftUI apps and generates `AppDelegate` adoption shims.

---

## 🚀 Phase 3: Scale & Desktop (v2.0.x+)
- [ ] **Cloud Coordination:** Synchronize task status and dependency resolution across multiple devices.
- [ ] **Enterprise Rate Limiting:** Advanced bandwidth and concurrency control for multi-tenant apps.
- [ ] **Desktop Support:** Expanding the native worker engine to Windows, macOS, and Linux.
