  /// Execute once after an optional delay.
  ///
  /// The most common trigger type. Schedules a task to run once, either
  /// immediately or after a specified delay.
  ///
  /// ## Immediate Execution
  ///
  /// ```dart
  /// await NativeWorkManager.enqueue(
  ///   taskId: 'immediate-task',
  ///   trigger: TaskTrigger.oneTime(),
  ///   worker: NativeWorker.httpRequest(url: 'https://api.example.com/ping'),
  /// );
  /// ```
  ///
  /// ## Delayed Execution
  ///
  /// ```dart
  /// // Execute after 5 minutes
  /// await NativeWorkManager.enqueue(
  ///   taskId: 'delayed-task',
  ///   trigger: TaskTrigger.oneTime(Duration(minutes: 5)),
  ///   worker: NativeWorker.httpSync(url: 'https://api.example.com/sync'),
  /// );
  ///
  /// // Execute after 1 hour
  /// await NativeWorkManager.enqueue(
  ///   taskId: 'hourly-reminder',
  ///   trigger: TaskTrigger.oneTime(Duration(hours: 1)),
  ///   worker: DartWorker(callbackId: 'sendNotification'),
  /// );
  /// ```
  ///
  /// ## Platform Behavior
  ///
  /// **Android:**
  /// - Immediate tasks (no delay) execute as soon as constraints are met
  /// - Delayed tasks use WorkManager's initial delay
  /// - Timing is approximate (not exact)
  /// - OS may defer execution to optimize battery
  ///
  /// **iOS:**
  /// - Uses BGProcessingTask for background execution
  /// - Execution timing is opportunistic (OS decides)
  /// - May not run immediately even with zero delay
  /// - Requires app to be in background for reasonable time
  ///
  /// ## Common Pitfalls
  ///
  /// ❌ **Don't** expect exact timing (use `exact()` for that)
  /// ❌ **Don't** use for time-critical operations
  /// ✅ **Do** use for most one-time background tasks
  /// ✅ **Do** add appropriate constraints
  ///
  /// ## See Also

  /// - [exact] - For alarm-style exact timing
  /// - [windowed] - For execution within a time range
  const factory TaskTrigger.oneTime([Duration initialDelay]) = OneTimeTrigger;

  /// Execute periodically at a fixed interval.
  ///
  /// Schedules a task to run repeatedly at the specified interval. Perfect for
  /// data syncing, periodic updates, or scheduled cleanup operations.
  ///
  /// **Important:** Minimum interval is 15 minutes on Android (OS limitation).
  ///
  /// ## Basic Periodic Task
  ///
  /// ```dart
  /// // Sync every hour
  /// await NativeWorkManager.enqueue(
  ///   taskId: 'hourly-sync',
  ///   trigger: TaskTrigger.periodic(Duration(hours: 1)),
  ///   worker: NativeWorker.httpSync(url: 'https://api.example.com/sync'),
  ///   constraints: Constraints.networkRequired,
  /// );
  /// ```
  ///
  /// ## Daily Cleanup
  ///
  /// ```dart
  /// // Clean up cache daily at opportune time
  /// await NativeWorkManager.enqueue(
  ///   taskId: 'daily-cleanup',
  ///   trigger: TaskTrigger.periodic(Duration(days: 1)),
  ///   worker: DartWorker(callbackId: 'cleanupCache'),
  /// );
  /// ```
  ///
  /// ## With Flex Interval (Android)
  ///
  /// ```dart
  /// // Sync every 6 hours, with 30-minute flex window
  /// // Task can run between 5.5 and 6 hours after last execution
  /// await NativeWorkManager.enqueue(
  ///   taskId: 'flexible-sync',
  ///   trigger: TaskTrigger.periodic(
  ///     Duration(hours: 6),
  ///     flexInterval: Duration(minutes: 30),
  ///   ),
  ///   worker: NativeWorker.httpSync(url: 'https://api.example.com/sync'),
  /// );
  /// ```
  ///
  /// ## Minimum Interval Example
  ///
  /// ```dart
  /// // Minimum allowed interval (15 minutes)
  /// await NativeWorkManager.enqueue(
  ///   taskId: 'frequent-check',
  ///   trigger: TaskTrigger.periodic(Duration(minutes: 15)),
  ///   worker: NativeWorker.httpRequest(url: 'https://api.example.com/status'),
  /// );
  /// ```
  ///
  /// ## Periodic Task with Initial Delay
  ///
  /// ```dart
  /// // Run every hour, but wait for the first hour before starting
  /// await NativeWorkManager.enqueue(
  ///   taskId: 'delayed-periodic-sync',
  ///   trigger: TaskTrigger.periodic(
  ///     Duration(hours: 1),
  ///     initialDelay: Duration(hours: 1),
  ///   ),
  ///   worker: NativeWorker.httpSync(url: 'https://api.example.com/sync'),
  /// );
  /// ```
  ///
  /// ## Skip First Run
  ///
  /// ```dart
  /// // Run every day, but don't run right now - wait for the first 24h
  /// await NativeWorkManager.enqueue(
  ///   taskId: 'daily-sync',
  ///   trigger: TaskTrigger.periodic(
  ///     Duration(days: 1),
  ///     runImmediately: false,
  ///   ),
  ///   worker: NativeWorker.httpSync(url: 'https://api.example.com/sync'),
  /// );
  /// ```
  ///
  /// ## Parameters
  ///
  /// **[interval]** - Time between executions.
  /// - Must be at least 15 minutes on Android
  /// - Throws `ArgumentError` if less than 15 minutes
  /// - iOS uses this as a hint (not guaranteed)
  ///
  /// **[flexInterval]** *(optional)* - Flex time window (Android only).
  /// - Allows Android to optimize execution time within this window
  /// - Example: 6-hour interval with 30-min flex = execute between 5.5-6 hours
  /// - Improves battery life by batching work
  /// - Ignored on iOS
  ///
  /// **[initialDelay]** *(optional)* - Delay before the very first execution.
  /// - On Android, the task will only run after this delay has passed.
  /// - Useful for scheduling tasks that shouldn't run immediately upon registration.
  /// - Supported on iOS (mapped to `earliestBeginDate`).
  ///
  /// **[runImmediately]** *(optional)* - Whether to run the task immediately.
  /// - Defaults to `true`.
  /// - If `false`, the first execution will happen after one [interval] has passed.
  /// - On Android, this is natively supported in WorkManager 2.1+.
  /// - On iOS, this is simulated by setting an initial delay equal to [interval].
  ///
  /// ## Platform Behavior
  ///
  /// **Android:**
  /// - Uses WorkManager PeriodicWorkRequest
  /// - Minimum interval: 15 minutes (OS limitation)
  /// - Flex interval helps Android optimize battery usage
  /// - Initial delay allows delaying the first run (WorkManager 2.1+)
  /// - Timing is approximate, not exact
  ///
  /// **iOS:**
  /// - Uses BGAppRefreshTask
  /// - Interval is a suggestion, not guaranteed
  /// - Initial delay supported via `earliestBeginDate`
  /// - OS decides actual execution timing
  /// - May run less frequently to save battery
  ///
  /// ## When to Use
  ///
  /// ✅ **Use periodic trigger for:**
  /// - Data synchronization every N hours
  /// - Periodic content updates
  /// - Scheduled cleanup operations
  /// - Background refresh of local data
  ///
  /// ❌ **Don't use periodic for:**
  /// - Intervals < 15 minutes (will throw error)
  /// - Time-sensitive operations (use `exact` instead)
  /// - User-initiated actions (use `oneTime` instead)
  ///
  /// ## Common Pitfalls
  ///
  /// ❌ **Don't** use intervals less than 15 minutes
  /// ❌ **Don't** expect exact timing (OS optimizes for battery)
  /// ❌ **Don't** rely on precise scheduling on iOS
  /// ❌ **Don't** schedule too many periodic tasks (battery drain)
  /// ✅ **Do** use flexInterval on Android for better battery life
  /// ✅ **Do** use initialDelay if the first run shouldn't happen immediately
  /// ✅ **Do** use `runImmediately: false` to skip the first execution
  /// ✅ **Do** combine with network constraints for data sync
  ///
  /// ## Battery Impact
  ///
  /// Periodic tasks can impact battery life:
  /// - Use longest acceptable interval
  /// - Add flex interval on Android
  /// - Use appropriate constraints (WiFi, charging)
  /// - Keep task execution time short
  ///
  /// ## See Also
  ///
  /// - [oneTime] - For one-time execution
  /// - [windowed] - For execution within a time window
  /// - [Constraints] - To optimize battery usage
  const factory TaskTrigger.periodic(
    Duration interval, {
    Duration? flexInterval,
    Duration? initialDelay,

  }) = PeriodicTrigger;

  /// Execute at an exact time (alarm-style).
  ///
  /// Schedules a task to run at a specific DateTime. Unlike oneTime, this
  /// attempts to execute at the EXACT specified time, like an alarm.
  ///
  /// **⚠️ Platform Limitations:** Exact timing has significant limitations,
  /// especially on iOS. Consider if you really need exact timing before using.
  ///
  /// ## Schedule for Specific Time
  ///
  /// ```dart
  /// // Schedule for tomorrow at 9 AM
  /// final tomorrow9am = DateTime.now()
  ///     .add(Duration(days: 1))
  ///     .copyWith(hour: 9, minute: 0, second: 0);
  ///
  /// await NativeWorkManager.enqueue(
  ///   taskId: 'morning-reminder',
  ///   trigger: TaskTrigger.exact(tomorrow9am),
  ///   worker: DartWorker(callbackId: 'sendReminder'),
  /// );
  /// ```
  ///
  /// ## Schedule for 2 Hours from Now
  ///
  /// ```dart
  /// await NativeWorkManager.enqueue(
  ///   taskId: 'delayed-notification',
  ///   trigger: TaskTrigger.exact(
  ///     DateTime.now().add(Duration(hours: 2)),
  ///   ),
  ///   worker: DartWorker(callbackId: 'showNotification'),
  /// );
  /// ```
  ///
  /// ## Platform Behavior & Limitations
  ///
  /// **Android (API 31+):**
  /// - Uses AlarmManager for exact timing
  /// - **Requires SCHEDULE_EXACT_ALARM permission** (auto-granted)
  /// - User can revoke permission in Settings
  /// - Task may fail if permission revoked
  /// - Battery optimization may still defer task
  /// - Most reliable of the two platforms
  ///
  /// **iOS:**
  /// - **Severely limited - NOT recommended**
  /// - Cannot guarantee code execution at exact time
  /// - Uses UNNotification as workaround
  /// - Requires user interaction to run code
  /// - Not suitable for background tasks
  /// - Consider using `oneTime` or `windowed` instead
  ///
  /// ## When to Use
  ///
  /// ✅ **Use exact trigger for (Android only):**
  /// - Alarm clock functionality
  /// - Scheduled reminders
  /// - Time-sensitive operations
  /// - Exact appointment notifications
  ///
  /// ❌ **Don't use exact trigger for:**
  /// - iOS apps (very limited)
  /// - Background data sync (use `periodic` instead)
  /// - Flexible timing tasks (use `oneTime` or `windowed`)
  /// - Battery-sensitive operations
  ///
  /// ## Common Pitfalls
  ///
  /// ❌ **Don't** rely on this for iOS (use notifications instead)
  /// ❌ **Don't** assume permission is always granted on Android
  /// ❌ **Don't** use for routine background tasks
  /// ❌ **Don't** forget to check if scheduledTime is in future
  /// ✅ **Do** check if time is in future before scheduling
  /// ✅ **Do** handle Android permission denial gracefully
  /// ✅ **Do** consider `oneTime` or `windowed` alternatives
  /// ✅ **Do** use local notifications for UI alerts
  ///
  /// ## Alternative Solutions
  ///
  /// For most use cases, consider these alternatives:
  ///
  /// ```dart
  /// // Instead of exact alarm, use windowed:
  /// TaskTrigger.windowed(
  ///   earliest: Duration(hours: 2),
  ///   latest: Duration(hours: 2, minutes: 15),
  /// )
  ///
  /// // Or use delayed oneTime:
  /// TaskTrigger.oneTime(Duration(hours: 2))
  ///
  /// // For UI notifications, use flutter_local_notifications:
  /// await flutterLocalNotificationsPlugin.zonedSchedule(
  ///   id,
  ///   title,
  ///   body,
  ///   scheduledDateTime,
  ///   notificationDetails,
  /// );
  /// ```
  ///
  /// ## Permission Handling (Android)
  ///
  /// ```dart
  /// // Check if exact alarm permission is available
  /// if (Platform.isAndroid && Build.VERSION.SDK_INT >= 31) {
  ///   final alarmManager = AlarmManager();
  ///   if (!await alarmManager.canScheduleExactAlarms()) {
  ///     // Show dialog explaining need for permission
  ///     // Direct user to settings
  ///   }
  /// }
  /// ```
  ///
  /// ## See Also
  ///
  /// - [oneTime] - For flexible one-time execution
  /// - [windowed] - For execution within a time window
  /// - [periodic] - For recurring tasks
  const factory TaskTrigger.exact(DateTime scheduledTime) = ExactTrigger;

  /// Execute within a time window.
  ///
  /// Schedules a task to run sometime between two time points. More flexible
  /// than exact timing, allowing the OS to optimize battery usage by choosing
  /// the best time within the window.
  ///
  /// ## Execute Between 1-2 Hours from Now
  ///
  /// ```dart
  /// await NativeWorkManager.enqueue(
  ///   taskId: 'flexible-sync',
  ///   trigger: TaskTrigger.windowed(
  ///     earliest: Duration(hours: 1),
  ///     latest: Duration(hours: 2),
  ///   ),
  ///   worker: NativeWorker.httpSync(url: 'https://api.example.com/sync'),
  /// );
  /// ```
  ///
  /// ## Night-Time Processing
  ///
  /// ```dart
  /// // Execute sometime between 2-4 AM (low usage period)
  /// await NativeWorkManager.enqueue(
  ///   taskId: 'night-processing',
  ///   trigger: TaskTrigger.windowed(
  ///     earliest: Duration(hours: 6), // 6 hours from now
  ///     latest: Duration(hours: 8),   // 8 hours from now
  ///   ),
  ///   worker: DartWorker(callbackId: 'processLargeDataset'),
  ///   constraints: Constraints(
  ///     requiresCharging: true,
  ///     requiresWifi: true,
  ///   ),
  /// );
  /// ```
  ///
  /// ## Platform Behavior
  ///
  /// **Android:**
  /// - Uses WorkManager's OneTimeWorkRequest with flex time
  /// - OS chooses optimal execution time within window
  /// - Batches with other work for battery efficiency
  ///
  /// **iOS:**
  /// - Uses BGProcessingTask
  /// - Window is advisory (OS may defer further)
  /// - Best effort scheduling
  ///
  /// ## When to Use
  ///
  /// ✅ **Use windowed trigger for:**
  /// - Flexible data synchronization
  /// - Background processing that isn't time-critical
  /// - Heavy tasks that should run during low-usage periods
  /// - Operations that can benefit from being batched with other work
  ///
  /// ❌ **Don't use windowed for:**
  /// - Time-critical operations
  /// - User-initiated actions (use `oneTime` instead)
  ///
  /// ## See Also
