/// System-level constraints for task execution (Android only).
///
/// **New in KMP WorkManager 2.2.0+**: SystemConstraints provide a cleaner way to
/// specify system-level requirements. These replace the deprecated trigger-based
/// approach (TaskTrigger.batteryLow, etc.) and the individual boolean flags.
///
/// **Platform Support**: Android only. iOS ignores these constraints.
///
/// ## Basic Usage
///
/// ```dart
/// await NativeWorkManager.enqueue(
///   taskId: 'maintenance-task',
///   trigger: TaskTrigger.oneTime(),
///   worker: DartWorker(callbackId: 'cleanup'),
///   constraints: Constraints(
///     systemConstraints: {
///       SystemConstraint.deviceIdle,  // Run when device is idle
///       SystemConstraint.allowLowStorage,  // OK to run on low storage
///     },
///   ),
/// );
/// ```
///
/// ## Constraint Types
///
/// **Storage Constraints:**
/// - `allowLowStorage` - Task can run even when storage is low
/// - Default behavior: Task waits for sufficient storage
///
/// **Battery Constraints:**
/// - `allowLowBattery` - Task can run even when battery is low
/// - `requireBatteryNotLow` - Task requires battery level to not be low
/// - Default behavior: No battery restriction
///
/// **System State:**
/// - `deviceIdle` - Task requires device to be idle (screen off, no user interaction)
/// - Use for maintenance tasks that should not impact user experience
///
/// ## Migration from Old API
///
/// **Before (deprecated triggers):**
/// ```dart
/// // OLD - deprecated in v2.2.0
/// trigger: TaskTrigger.storageLow,  // or batteryLow, deviceIdle
/// ```
///
/// **After (SystemConstraints):**
/// ```dart
/// // NEW - recommended approach
/// constraints: Constraints(
///   systemConstraints: {SystemConstraint.allowLowStorage},
/// )
/// ```
///
/// **Before (boolean flags):**
/// ```dart
/// // OLD - still works but less flexible
/// constraints: Constraints(
///   requiresStorageNotLow: true,
///   requiresBatteryNotLow: true,
///   requiresDeviceIdle: true,
/// )
/// ```
///
/// **After (SystemConstraints - more explicit):**
/// ```dart
/// // NEW - clearer intent
/// constraints: Constraints(
///   systemConstraints: {
///     SystemConstraint.deviceIdle,
///     SystemConstraint.requireBatteryNotLow,
///   },
/// )
/// ```
///
/// ## Common Patterns
///
/// **Maintenance Task (idle device, low priority):**
/// ```dart
/// Constraints(
///   systemConstraints: {
///     SystemConstraint.deviceIdle,
///     SystemConstraint.allowLowStorage,
///     SystemConstraint.allowLowBattery,
///   },
///   qos: QoS.utility,
/// )
/// ```
///
/// **Critical Task (needs resources):**
/// ```dart
/// Constraints(
///   systemConstraints: {
///     SystemConstraint.requireBatteryNotLow,
///   },
///   requiresNetwork: true,
///   requiresCharging: true,
/// )
/// ```
///
/// **Background Sync (opportunistic):**
/// ```dart
/// Constraints(
///   systemConstraints: {
///     SystemConstraint.allowLowBattery,  // Run even on low battery
///   },
///   requiresNetwork: true,
/// )
/// ```
///
/// ## Platform Behavior
///
/// **Android:**
/// - Maps to WorkManager's SystemConstraint API
/// - Enforced by Android WorkManager
/// - Affects task scheduling and execution
///
/// **iOS:**
/// - Ignored (not applicable to iOS background tasks)
/// - iOS has different constraint system
/// - Use iOS-specific constraints like `requiresCharging` instead
///
/// ## Best Practices
///
/// ✅ **Do** use SystemConstraints for explicit intent
/// ✅ **Do** combine with other constraints (network, charging)
/// ✅ **Do** use deviceIdle for maintenance tasks
/// ✅ **Do** use allowLowStorage/allowLowBattery for non-critical tasks
///
/// ❌ **Don't** mix old triggers with new SystemConstraints
/// ❌ **Don't** expect SystemConstraints to work on iOS
/// ❌ **Don't** use deviceIdle for user-initiated tasks
///
/// See also:
/// - [Constraints] - Container for all constraint types
/// - [TaskTrigger] - When tasks should execute

  /// - No user interaction
  /// - Device has been idle for a period
  ///
  /// Use this for tasks that:

/// iOS background task type selection (iOS 13.0+ only).
///
/// **New in KMP WorkManager 2.2.0+**: Control which iOS BGTask type is used
/// for background execution. Each type has different time limits and capabilities.
///
/// **Platform Support**: iOS only. Android ignores this setting.
///
/// ## Task Types
///
/// **BGAppRefreshTask (appRefresh):**
/// - Time limit: ~30 seconds total
/// - Task timeout: 20 seconds
/// - Chain timeout: 50 seconds
/// - Use case: Quick sync, small updates, lightweight operations
/// - Frequency: System-determined (multiple times per day)
///
/// **BGProcessingTask (processing):**
/// - Time limit: 5-10 minutes
/// - Task timeout: 120 seconds (2 minutes)
/// - Chain timeout: 300 seconds (5 minutes)
/// - Use case: Heavy processing, large downloads/uploads, data migration
/// - Frequency: Less frequent (overnight, device charging)
/// - Requires: `requiresCharging` or `requiresNetwork` in constraints
///
/// ## Auto-Selection Behavior
///
/// If `bgTaskType` is **not specified** (null), the system auto-selects based on:
/// - `isHeavyTask = true` → BGProcessingTask
/// - `isHeavyTask = false` → BGAppRefreshTask
///
/// ## Basic Usage
///
/// **Auto-Selection (Recommended):**
/// ```dart
/// // System chooses based on isHeavyTask
/// await NativeWorkManager.enqueue(
///   taskId: 'sync',
///   trigger: TaskTrigger.oneTime(),
///   worker: NativeWorker.httpSync(url: 'https://api.example.com/sync'),
///   constraints: Constraints(
///     isHeavyTask: false,  // → BGAppRefreshTask
///   ),
/// );
/// ```
///
/// **Manual Selection:**
/// ```dart
/// // Force BGAppRefreshTask for quick sync
/// await NativeWorkManager.enqueue(
///   taskId: 'quick-sync',
///   trigger: TaskTrigger.oneTime(),
///   worker: NativeWorker.httpSync(url: 'https://api.example.com/sync'),
///   constraints: Constraints(
///     bgTaskType: BGTaskType.appRefresh,  // Explicit
///     requiresNetwork: true,
///   ),
/// );
/// ```
///
/// ## When to Use Each Type
///
/// **Use appRefresh for:**
/// - Quick API sync (<30s)
/// - Small data uploads
/// - Fast health checks
/// - Lightweight maintenance
/// - Frequent operations
///
/// ```dart
/// Constraints(
///   bgTaskType: BGTaskType.appRefresh,
///   requiresNetwork: true,
/// )
/// ```
///
/// **Use processing for:**
/// - Large file uploads/downloads (minutes)
/// - Video/image processing
/// - Database migrations
/// - ML model inference
/// - Batch operations
///
/// ```dart
/// Constraints(
///   bgTaskType: BGTaskType.processing,
///   requiresNetwork: true,
///   requiresCharging: true,  // Recommended
///   isHeavyTask: true,
/// )
/// ```
///
/// ## Time-Slicing (KMP 2.2.1+)
///
/// For large queues, KMP WorkManager automatically:
/// - Uses 85% of available time for tasks
/// - Reserves 15% for cleanup
/// - Stops early when time is insufficient
/// - Schedules continuation for remaining tasks
///
/// ## Info.plist Configuration
///
/// Both task types must be declared in Info.plist:
///
/// ```xml
/// <key>BGTaskSchedulerPermittedIdentifiers</key>
/// <array>
///   <string>dev.brewkits.native_workmanager.refresh</string>
///   <string>dev.brewkits.native_workmanager.task</string>
/// </array>
/// ```
///
/// ## Platform Behavior
///
/// **iOS:**
/// - Maps to BGTaskScheduler API
/// - Time limits strictly enforced by iOS
/// - Processing tasks run less frequently
/// - System decides actual execution timing
///
/// **Android:**
/// - Setting is ignored (not applicable)
/// - Android WorkManager uses different scheduling
/// - Use `isHeavyTask` for foreground service on Android
///
/// ## Common Pitfalls
///
/// ❌ **Don't** use processing for quick operations (wastes battery)
/// ❌ **Don't** use appRefresh for operations >30 seconds (will fail)
/// ❌ **Don't** forget Info.plist configuration (tasks won't run)
/// ❌ **Don't** rely on exact timing (iOS schedules opportunistically)
///
/// ✅ **Do** prefer auto-selection (leave null, set isHeavyTask)
/// ✅ **Do** handle task interruption gracefully
/// ✅ **Do** use processing for long operations
/// ✅ **Do** test with actual background conditions
///
/// ## Best Practices
///
/// 1. **Default to auto-selection**: Let `isHeavyTask` control type
/// 2. **Test timeouts**: Verify operations complete within limits
/// 3. **Handle interruption**: Save progress if task is stopped early
/// 4. **Monitor metrics**: Use TaskEventBus for execution time tracking
/// 5. **Optimize for appRefresh**: Most tasks should complete in 30s

/// - Permissions: `BODY_SENSORS`, `HIGH_SAMPLING_RATE_SENSORS` (if applicable)
/// - Manifest: `<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.FOREGROUND_SERVICE_HEALTH"/>`
///
/// ## Basic Usage
///
/// **Default (dataSync):**
/// ```dart
/// await NativeWorkManager.enqueue(
///   taskId: 'large-upload',
///   trigger: TaskTrigger.oneTime(),
///   worker: NativeWorker.httpUpload(
///     url: 'https://cdn.example.com/upload',

///     isHeavyTask: true,
///     foregroundServiceType: ForegroundServiceType.mediaPlayback,
///     requiresCharging: true,
///   ),
/// );
/// ```
///
/// ## AndroidManifest.xml Configuration
///
/// Add permission for the service type you're using:
///
/// ```xml
/// <manifest>
///   <!-- For location tasks -->
///   <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.FOREGROUND_SERVICE_LOCATION"/>
///   <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION"/>

///   <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.FOREGROUND_SERVICE_HEALTH"/>
///   <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.BODY_SENSORS"/>
/// </manifest>
/// ```
///
/// ## Validation Strategy (KMP 2.1.2+)
///
/// KMP WorkManager uses **FAIL OPEN** validation:
/// - Validates permissions on Android 14+ (API 34+)
/// - Falls back to `dataSync` if validation fails
/// - Ensures compatibility with Chinese ROMs (Xiaomi, Oppo, etc.)
/// - Never crashes due to missing permissions
///
/// ## Platform Behavior
///
/// **Android 14+ (API 34+):**
/// - Foreground service type is required and validated
/// - Missing permissions → fallback to dataSync
/// - Notification shows during task execution
///
/// **Android <14:**
/// - Setting is ignored (not required)
/// - Heavy tasks still run as foreground services
/// - Any type works without validation
///
/// **iOS:**
/// - Setting is completely ignored
/// - iOS uses BGTaskScheduler (no foreground services)
/// - Use `bgTaskType` for iOS task type selection
///
/// ## When to Use Each Type
///
/// | Type | Use Case | Permissions Required |
/// |------|----------|----------------------|
/// | dataSync | Default, file upload/download | None |
/// | location | GPS tracking, location services | FINE or COARSE location |
/// | mediaPlayback | Audio/video playback | None |
/// | camera | Camera operations | CAMERA |
/// | microphone | Audio recording | RECORD_AUDIO |
/// | health | Health/fitness data | BODY_SENSORS |
///
/// ## Common Pitfalls
///
/// ❌ **Don't** forget manifest permissions (task will fall back to dataSync)
/// ❌ **Don't** use without `isHeavyTask = true` (no effect)
/// ❌ **Don't** expect exact type on Chinese ROMs (FAIL OPEN)
/// ❌ **Don't** use for tasks <30 seconds (foreground overhead)
///
/// ✅ **Do** add manifest permissions for your service type
/// ✅ **Do** use dataSync as safe default for uploads/downloads
/// ✅ **Do** combine with appropriate constraints
/// ✅ **Do** test on Android 14+ devices
///
/// ## Best Practices
///
/// 1. **Default to dataSync**: Safe for most heavy tasks
/// 2. **Add manifest entries**: Always declare required permissions
/// 3. **Test on Android 14+**: Verify behavior on modern devices
/// 4. **Handle fallback**: App works even with wrong type (falls back to dataSync)

///     requiresDeviceIdle: true,
///     requiresBatteryNotLow: true,
///     requiresStorageNotLow: true,
///   ),
/// );
/// ```
///
/// ## Common Constraint Patterns
///
/// **Data Sync (Network Required):**
/// ```dart
/// Constraints(requiresNetwork: true)
/// ```
///
/// **Large Upload (WiFi + Battery Safe):**
/// ```dart
/// Constraints(
///   requiresUnmeteredNetwork: true,
///   requiresCharging: true,
///   isHeavyTask: true,
/// )
/// ```
///
/// **Maintenance Task (Device Idle):**

/// ```
///
/// ## Static Helpers
///
/// - [networkRequired] - Simple network requirement
/// - [heavyTask] - WiFi + charging for large operations
/// - [none] - No constraints (runs ASAP)
///
/// ## When to Use Constraints
///
/// ✅ **Use constraints for:**
/// - Network-dependent operations (API calls, uploads)
/// - Battery-intensive tasks (video processing)
/// - Storage-intensive operations (downloads, caching)
/// - Maintenance work (cleanup, optimization)
///
/// ❌ **Don't use constraints for:**
/// - Time-critical operations
/// - User-initiated actions (use no constraints)
/// - Tasks that must run immediately
///
/// ## Battery Impact
///
/// More constraints = Better battery life:
/// - Tasks deferred until optimal conditions
/// - OS can batch work together
/// - Prevents running on cellular data
/// - Avoids draining battery
///
/// ## Platform Differences
///
/// **Android:**
/// - All constraints enforced by WorkManager
