## [1.3.2] - 2026-07-07

- Version bump synchronized with `native_workmanager` 1.3.2. No codegen changes — the
  1.3.2 fixes (iOS BGTask launch-window crash, kmpworkmanager core upgrade) are runtime-only
  and do not affect `@WorkerCallback` code generation.

## [1.3.1] - 2026-06-07

- Version bump synchronized with `native_workmanager` 1.3.1.

## [1.3.0] - 2026-06-04

---

## [1.0.4] - 2026-04-20

### Fixed
- Widened `analyzer` constraint from `^12.0.0` to `>=10.0.0 <13.0.0` to resolve
  `meta` version conflict on Flutter 3.41.x (`analyzer 10.x` requires `meta ^1.15.0`).
- Replaced deprecated `getDisplayString(withNullability: false)` with `getDisplayString()`.

---

## [1.0.3]

### Changed
- Require `analyzer >=12.0.0` and Dart SDK `>=3.9.0`.
- Replaced `FunctionElement` (removed in analyzer 12.x) with `ElementKind.FUNCTION` check
  and `TopLevelFunctionElement` cast.
- Replaced `element.parameters` with `fn.formalParameters` (renamed in analyzer 12.x).
- Replaced `element.name` with `element.displayName` (now `String?` in analyzer 12.x).

---

## [1.0.2]

### Fixed
- Replaced `TypeChecker.fromRuntime` (removed in source_gen 4.x) with `TypeChecker.fromUrl` —
  removes `dart:mirrors` dependency and fixes static analysis on pub.dev.
- Removed `native_workmanager` from runtime dependencies (only needed at build time via URI).

---

## [1.0.1]

### Changed
- Widened dependency constraints: `build <5`, `source_gen <5`, `analyzer <13`, `build_runner <4`.

### Added
- Dartdoc to `workerCallbackBuilder` and `WorkerCallbackGenerator` constructor.
- Example demonstrating codegen setup.

---

## [1.0.0]

### Added
- Initial release: `@WorkerCallback` annotation code generator for `native_workmanager`.
- Generates type-safe callback IDs and worker registry from annotated top-level functions.
- Validates callback signature (`Future<bool>` return type, `String?` parameter).
