## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Tasks Not Executing

**iOS:**
```
1. Check Info.plist has BGTaskSchedulerPermittedIdentifiers
2. Enable Background Modes in Xcode
3. Test on real device (simulator has limitations)
4. Check Console.app for BGTaskScheduler logs
```

**Android:**
```bash
# Check WorkManager status
adb logcat | grep WorkManager

# Check battery optimization
adb shell dumpsys battery

# Check task status
adb shell dumpsys jobscheduler
```

### Event Log Not Updating

1. Restart app
2. Check `NativeWorkManager.initialize()` was called
3. Verify event stream subscription
4. Check device logs (Logcat/Console)

### ContentUri Not Triggering (Android)

1. Grant storage permissions
2. Use correct URI format: `content://media/external/images/media`
3. Set `triggerForDescendants: true`
4. Take photo or download image (don't just view)
